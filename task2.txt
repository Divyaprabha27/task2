1.Difference between document and window object
------------------------------------------------------

Document is loaded inside the browser and window object which are seeing the content. Document is loaded after the window and window object loaded before the document because window
contain container document.

Document is the root element window object is the global element for all functions and objects. Document is object of the window and window is object of the browser.

In document object we cannot access window objects properties inside the document. In window obejct we can access document obeject properties insdide the window.

document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model) but window object is part of BOM, not DOM.

syntax of document object is
	document.propertyname;

syntax of window object is
	window.propertyname;

Example of document object (document.title) will return the title of the document. Example of window object (window.title) will return the title of the document.
